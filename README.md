## My process
I began by sketching to help word out out what properties are are used to design. This helped to beat the initial project weariness. After that, i executed with Html structure first , followed by cs from top to bottom as guided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

As a complete beginner, this challenge provided some space to tinker with what i have learnt. SUch as testing max widths, styling fonts, and border-radius.


```css
.body {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin: 50px auto;
    padding: 40px;
    max-width: 620px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    position: relative;
    min-width:375px;
}
```


### Continued development

As of date, I have learnt on CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid. I intend touse hese techniques in time to refine my skills.
